* I am a Cyber Security Student at Curtin University.
* I am currently a part of the Australian CTF team [0x1](https://ctftime.org/team/83157).
* I plan to become a security researcher specializing in native application security.

This blog is a collection of CTF writeups and other security-related things. Please contact me by e-mail if you have any questions.
