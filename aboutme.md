# About me

I currently work as a security engineer. I do 0-day/N-day research and exploit development, focused mainly around browsers.

I completed my Bachelor's in Computer Science at Curtin University at the end of 2020.

Outside of work, I also play CTFs with teams [Super Guesser](https://guesser.team) and [perfect guesser](https://ctftime.org/team/142232).
