# About me

I do vulnerability research.

I completed my Bachelor's in Computer Science at Curtin University at the end of 2020.

Outside of work, I also play CTFs with teams [Super Guesser](https://guesser.team) and [perfect guesser](https://ctftime.org/team/142232).

Any views expressed on this blog are solely my own and not my employers'.
